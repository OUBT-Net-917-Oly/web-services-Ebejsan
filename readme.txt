Week 5 - Web Services

Note this repository has two different solutions in it.  There is the ShowWeb and ShowService solutions.  You will use two seperate instances of Visual Studio to work with them.  So go to the repository folder in File Explorer and then browse to the *.sln files and open them by clicking them or by opening VS and then browse to the solutions.
